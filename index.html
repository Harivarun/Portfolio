    <p>
      Hi, I'm Sri Hari Varun Marubattula, and Iâ€™m an experienced **AEM Developer** and **Full-Stack Java Developer** with over 6 years of experience working on a wide range of web applications and enterprise-level solutions. My passion lies in solving complex problems, building scalable solutions, and ensuring that every project I work on is optimized for both performance and user experience.
    </p>
    
    <h5>AEM Development Expertise</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Throughout my career, I have gained significant expertise in **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)**, particularly in **AEM 6.4 & 6.5**. I have developed custom **AEM components**, **Sling models**, and **Servlets**, allowing businesses to manage their content efficiently and dynamically.</li>
      <li>In addition to component development, I focus on ensuring that the solutions I build are user-friendly and scalable. I've worked on creating and enhancing **multifield components**, as well as ensuring code quality through **Junit tests** and improving **code coverage**.</li>
      <li>I enjoy working on the back-end side of AEM, building robust services using **Sling models** and ensuring that content delivery is fast, reliable, and secure.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Full-Stack Java Development</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>As a **Full-Stack Developer**, my back-end development expertise lies in **Java** and **Spring Boot**. I have a lot of experience in building REST APIs and server-side logic that can handle complex business operations efficiently. My focus is always on creating scalable solutions that perform well under high traffic and data loads.</li>
      <li>On the front-end side, I am skilled in using **HTML5**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap** to design responsive and interactive user interfaces. I take pride in building user experiences that are intuitive and accessible, ensuring that applications not only work well but also look great across devices.</li>
      <li>I've also had the opportunity to lead and manage **migration projects**, including upgrading legacy systems from **Java 7 to Java 8** and moving from **Artifactory to Nexus**, which have improved both performance and maintainability.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Tools & Technologies</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>In addition to my development work, I use **Jenkins** for automating CI/CD pipelines and ensuring continuous integration. This helps me deliver features faster while maintaining high code quality with **GIT** for version control.</li>
